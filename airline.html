                <p>Beacon was a three month engagement to help an airline navigate through the complexities of the aviation business with the business in mind and with the traveller at heart; uncovering the different types of customer that they serve, along with their needs, pain points and behaviours across the end to end travel journey. Meanwhile, developing their internal customer experience and service design capabilities, training a team in service design and research methodologies.</p>

            <h2>How might we better understand the airline’s customers today, so that we can design products and services they truly desire, and align our business units to deliver them?</h2>

                <h3>Glimpse into the Process</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="mainbody-02">
                <p>As part of the engagement, the Fjord and Customer Experience team worked closely together to transfer and cross-pollinate design thinking skills and domain specific knowledge. Specifically for the Customer Experience team, it was to have a better understanding of how best to use ‘Design Thinking’ methods within the wider organization, empowering them to take ownership of the customer experience and be the voice of the customer in current and future projects.</p>
                <h5 class="grey">STARTING FROM THE BASICS</h5> 
                <p>From creating discussion guides to interviewing customers to synthesizing the findings, the Customer Experience team was taught on the intricacies of the design process. This often started out as a mini theory session before doing hands-on practice in the field. Side by side, both teams conducted field observations at the lounges and service centers, interviewing stakeholders, staff and customers to get a better understanding of the needs and pain points of both the business and the customers they served.</p>

        <div class="mainbody-03">
            <p>The research accumulated to 5 high level themes which were later introduced to the staff in a workshop where we brought together multiple customer service and product development business units. Through this process, the organisation reached a common understanding of their customers and their journeys, coming up with several service concepts that were taken to cross-functional teams.</p>

        <h3>The Design</h3>

            <div class="mainbody-04">
                <p>7 high-value service concepts were crafted collaboratively and taken into refinement. These concepts ranged from enhancing the inflight entertainment system to a new policy that empowered staff to make exceptions. Each service concept tackled several pain points that were identified during the research and how it would bring value for the business. <br><br>Update: The airline took forward 3 concepts and are currently testing it in the field.</p>

                <p>Taking into consideration of the company’s core values, 6 design principles were created to help establish a framework for future decision making, providing guidance about what a right decision would be. Each design principle was further illustrated on what it meant for the product, people and process.</p>

                    <p>Due to the complexity of the industry and silos within the organisation, it was rare for a person to have a complete picture. Therefore, a living service blueprint was created to have a unified view on the backstage processes on how services were orchestrated between the different business units and the various dependecies in the system. Additionally, the blueprint was created to be editable so that the team could continuously update it.</p>
