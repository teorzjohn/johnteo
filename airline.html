          Beacon was a three-month engagement to help an airline 
          navigate through the complexities of the aviation business 
          with the business in mind and with the traveler at heart; uncovering 
          the different types of customer that they serve, along with their 
          needs, pain points and behaviors across the end to end travel journey. 
          Meanwhile, developing their internal customer experience and service 
          design capabilities, training a team in service design and research methodologies.

        How might we better understand the airline’s customers today, so that we
        can design products and services they truly desire and align our

        <h3>Glimpse into the Process</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainbody-02">
        <p>
          As part of the engagement, the Fjord and Customer Experience team
          worked closely together to transfer and cross-pollinate design
          thinking skills and domain-specific knowledge. Specifically for the
          Customer Experience team, it was to have a better understanding of how
          best to use ‘Design Thinking’ methods within the wider organization,
          empowering them to take ownership of the customer experience and be
          the voice of the customer in current and future projects.
        </p>
        <h5 class="grey">STARTING FROM THE BASICS</h5>
        <p>
          From creating discussion guides to interviewing customers to
          synthesizing the findings, the Customer Experience team was taught on
          the intricacies of the design process. This often started as a
          mini theory session before doing hands-on practice in the field. Side
          by side, both teams conducted field observations at the lounges and
          service centers, interviewing stakeholders, staff and customers to get
          a better understanding of the needs and pain points of both the
          business and the customers they served.

      <p>
        The research accumulated to 5 high-level themes which were later
        introduced to the staff in a workshop where we brought together multiple
        customer service and product development business units. Through this
        process, the organization reached a common understanding of their
        customers and their journeys, coming up with several service concepts
        that were taken to cross-functional teams.

          7 high-value service concepts were crafted collaboratively and taken
          into refinement. These concepts ranged from enhancing the inflight
          entertainment system to a new policy that empowered staff to make
          exceptions. Each service concept tackled several pain points that were
          identified during the research and how it would bring value to the
          business. <br /><br />Update: The airline took forward 3 concepts and
          is currently testing it in the field.

          Taking into consideration the company’s core values, 6 design principles 
          were created to help establish a framework for future decision making. 
          Each design principle was further illustrated on what it meant for the 
          product, people and process.

          Due to the complexity of the industry and silos within the
          organization, it was rare for a person to have a complete picture.
          Therefore, a living service blueprint was created to have a unified
          view on the backstage processes on how services were orchestrated
          between the different business units and the various dependecies in
          the system. Additionally, the blueprint was created to be editable so
          that the team could continuously update it.
