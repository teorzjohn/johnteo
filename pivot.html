          Pivot is a descriptive analytics platform that integrates information from 
          disparate systems and organizational groups across an oil and gas company. 
          Providing dashboards, reports, information visualizations, and tools to workers at 
          all levels so that they can make an informed decision and subsequently coordinate actions. 
          In doing so, it works as a single source of reference for key plant performance 
          indicators from the ground floor to the board room.

          Building upon what was done in the previous phase, the team worked on a 
          list of key jobs that were identified by the former team. These key jobs 
          were tackled in 2 weeks sprint which uncovered different sets of user needs. 
          Each sprint started off with an ideation workshop with staff from different 
          parts of the organization. Though each ideation workshop was different, it 
          broadly involved understanding the current work process (tasks, data points, 
          blockers, systems, etc.), ideas for improvements and prioritization of features.

        Before heading to digital prototypes, quick paper prototypes were
        created to get a better grasp of the user flows which helped to align
        the team on the screens that were needed. Subsequently, these digital
        prototypes were shown to relevant users for feedback.

          Due to the number of operation units and various departments 
          that the organization had, it was crucial to have one product that 
          could serve a consistent experience across the organization. This meant 
          aligning and designing a single interaction model with refined information 
          architecture. The columns represent the summary of all perspectives 
          related to an asset; while the rows represent the specific function 
          or perspective.

          Bars and lines, chains and flows, pyramids and breakdowns - these 
          were just some of the data visualizations that users wished to have 
          in the system. Additionally, different users had different ways that 
          they would like to compare and contrast the data. Thus, we created a 
          single scalable module for all KPIs across the organization. This 
          allowed users the flexibility to filter and sort the data by type, time 
          and frequency in various visualizations that they were accustomed to.

          From the board room to the plant workers on the ground, PIVOT had to 
          accommodate for different types of users. The upper management tended 
          to check reports and key KPIs on their phones. Therefore, the platform 
          needed to be glanceable to know the overall health of the assets; 
          with the option to drill down to the root cause when needed.
