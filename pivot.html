                <p>Pivot is a descriptive analytics platform that integrates information from disparate systems and organisational groups across an oil and gas company. Providing dashboards, reports, information visualisations and tools to workers at all levels so that they can make informed decision and subsequently coordinate actions. In doing so, it works as the single source of reference for key plant performance indicators from the ground floor to the board room.</p>

            <div class="mainbody-02">
                <p>Building upon what was done in the previous phase, the team worked on a list of key jobs that were identified by the former team. These key jobs were tackled in 2 weeks sprint which uncovered different sets of user needs. Each sprint started off with an ideation workshop with staff from different parts of the organisation. Though each ideation workshop was different, it broadly involved understanding the current work process (tasks, data points, blockers, systems etc.), ideas for improvements and prioritisation of features.</p>

            <p>Before heading to digital prototypes, quick paper prototypes were created to get a better grasp of the user flows which helped to align the team on the screens that were needed. Subsequently, these digital prototypes were shown to relevant users for feedback.</p>

                <p>Due to the number of operation units and various department that the organisation had, it was crucial to have one product that could serve a consistent experience across the organisation. This meant aligning and designing a single interaction model with a refined information architecture. The columns represent the summary of all perspectives related to an asset; while the rows represent the specific funtion or perspective.</p>

                <p>Bars and lines, chains and flows, pyramids and breakdowns - these were just some of the data visualisations that users wished to have in the system. Additionally, different users had different ways that they would like to compare and contrast the data. Thus, we created a single scalable module for all KPIs across the organisation. This allowed users the flexibility to filter and sort the data by type, time and frequency in various visualisations that they were accustomed to.</p>

                    <p>From the board room to the plant workers on the ground, PIVOT had to acommodate for different types of users. The upper management had a tendency to check reports and key KPIs on their phones. Therefore, it was crucial that the platform was glanceable to know the overall health of the assets; with the option to drill down to the root cause when needed.</p>
