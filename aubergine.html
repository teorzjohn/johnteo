                <p>Everyone knows the importance of getting 8 hours of sleep, but that just is not the reality for most. How many times do you catch yourself dozing off throughout the day? What if you could snooze comfortably, right there and then? The Aubergine Pillow is an inflatable pillow that plumps up generously in one puff, yet compacts small, affording us the everyday comfort we hunger for. Successfully funded on Kickstarter, it has since been manufactured and is now distributed worldwide.</p>

                <h3>Glimpse into the Process</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="mainbody-02">
                <p>In a span of 3 months, the pillow was developed and prototyped before it was launched on Kickstarter. It was successfully funded on December 2016, reaching 450% of its original funding goal. After the campaign, the team worked extensively with overseas suppliers, sourcing for the best materials and manufacturing processes. Meanwhile, refining the Aubergine Pillow to ensure that it was optimised for mass manufacturing. In addition to ensuring the feasibility of the process, the team had to ensure that it was within budget without compromising on the user experience or product quality. </p>

            <div class="mainbody-04">
                <p>The Aubergine Pillow inflates effortlessly with just a single puff. This is made possible by employing the Bernoulli Effect. When blowing a few inches away from the spout, the surrounding air is drawn into the spout as well, ensuring that the volume of air that goes into pillow is much greater than the volume of oneâ€™s breath.</p>

                <p>The Aubergine Pillow deflates fast, rolls snug and compacts small, ensuring that you can resume normal life, as fast as you can wake. When compacted, The Aubergine Pillow is no larger than your iPhone 7, fitting perfectly into your bag, and your lifestyle.</p>
