          DBS, the largest bank in South East Asia, was looking to change the
          design of their ATM+ and BTM+ user interface. Part of a two man team,
          we covered all the product design needs from research, usability
          testing, to the interaction and visual design explorations. The
          designs were developed and rolled out nationwide in the last quarter
          of 2018.

          Prior research was done before we came onboard. However, in order to
          have a holistic understanding of the different transactions within the
          system, we felt that it was crucial for us to go down to the ATM+ and
          BTM+ machines to experience all the various transactions first hand.
          These included common transactions such as withdrawal and depositing
          of money to the more little-known cases such as cash exchange and
          card-less transactions. In conjunction, we talked to the team who
          designed the current system to find out more about the challenges and
          reasoning behind certain implementations.
        </p>
        <h5 class="grey">THE VISUALS</h5>
        <p>
          Additionally, a management decision was made to combine both DBS and
          POSB exisiting designs for the ATM; moving towards a 'brand-less'
          screen state. The screens had to look differentiated enough so that it
          did not look too similar to either of the two brands. In addition, it
          should not encroach with other banks visual language.

        Drawing from other existing platfoms within the bank ecosystem and from
        our study of the major banks in Singapore, we decided to experiment with
        the different tonal value of greys. Grey connoted a sense of maturity
        and dependability and was a colour that was not used by any of the other
        banks.

      <h5 class="grey">USER TESTING</h5>
      <p>
        Before rolling out the new system to the public, a group of participants
        were selected to use, test and provide feedback on the new changes in
        the ATM+ and BTM+ user interface design. In the hour long session,
        participants were provided with a series of tasks (Eg. Withdraw $50 from
        your POSB Savings Account). Once a task was completed, questions were
        posed to the participants based on their actions to better understand
        their thought process. At different points of the task flow, A/B testing
        was conducted to get a grasp of users' preferences and test
        understandability of the screens.

          One of the major changes was to include an additional screen before
          the home screen. Though it adds extra time per transaction to the
          current flow, it allows for simpler navigation between the different
          transactions. In addition, it allows for future scalability of the
          system.

          We did a full audit of the system and one of the features that was
          removed was the ability to change the text size. Users were unaware of
          the feature and this was backed by data collected whereby the feature
          was access ~0.03% over 12 months period. Though we removed the
          feature, we recognized the intention and the need for larger font
          sizes overall which was implemented in the new design.

          During the user testing, one of the users pointed out that if it was
          too grey, users might think that the machine is faulty. Thus, we
          tweaked the grey to be warmer to make it feel more personal and
          inviting. Furthermore, we decided to add in a colour highlight which
          was taken from DBS Wealth Management.
