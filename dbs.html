            DBS, the largest bank in South East Asia, was looking to change the
            design of their ATM+ and BTM+ user interface. Part of a two man
            team, we covered all the product design needs from research,
            usability testing, to the interaction and visual design
            explorations. The designs were developed and rolled out nationwide
            in the last quarter of 2018.

        <div class="mainbody-02">
          <p>
            Prior research was done before we came onboard. However, to have a
            holistic understanding of the different transactions within the
            system, we felt that we needed to go down to the ATM+ and BTM+
            machines to experience all the various transactions first hand.
            These included common transactions such as withdrawal and depositing
            of money to the more little-known cases such as cash exchange and
            card-less transactions. In conjunction, we talked to the team who
            designed the current system to find out more about the challenges
            and reasoning behind certain implementations.
          </p>
          <h5 class="grey">THE VISUALS</h5>
          <p>
            Additionally, a management decision was made to combine both DBS and
            POSB existing designs for the ATM; moving towards a 'brand-less'
            screen state. The screens had to look differentiated enough so that
            it did not look too similar to either of the two brands. In
            addition, it should not encroach with other banks visual language.

          Drawing from other existing platforms within the bank ecosystem and
          from our study of the major banks in Singapore, we decided to
          experiment with the different tonal value of greys. Grey connoted a
          sense of maturity and dependability and was a color that was not used
          by any of the other banks.

        <h5 class="grey">USER TESTING</h5>
        <p>
          Before rolling out the new system to the public, a group of
          participants was selected to use, test and provide feedback on the new
          changes in the ATM+ and BTM+ user interface design. In the hour-long
          session, participants were provided with a series of tasks (Eg.
          Withdraw $50 from your POSB Savings Account). Once a task was
          completed, questions were posed to the participants based on their
          actions to better understand their thought process. At different
          points of the task flow, A/B testing was conducted to get a grasp of
          users' preferences and test the understandability of the screens.

            One of the major changes was to include an additional screen before
            the home screen. Though it adds extra time per transaction to the
            current flow, it allows for simpler navigation between the different
            transactions. Besides, it allows for future scalability of the
            system.

            We did a full audit of the system and one of the features that was
            removed was the ability to change the text size. Users were unaware
            of the feature and this was backed by data collected whereby the
            feature was access ~0.03% over 12 months period. Though we removed
            the feature, we recognized the intention and the need for larger
            font sizes overall which was implemented in the new design.

            During the user testing, one of the users pointed out that if it was
            too grey, users might think that the machine is faulty. Thus, we
            tweaked the grey to be warmer to make it feel more personal and
            inviting. Furthermore, we decided to add in a colour highlight which
            was taken from DBS Treasures.
