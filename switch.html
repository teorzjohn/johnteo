            <p>Switch is a learning platform that aims to upskill employees 
              in this period of digital transformation. Topics such as data analytics, 
              cybersecurity, and ongoing digital initiatives are introduced in short-form 
              content to make it engaging and easily digestible for users. Additionally, 
              users can test their understanding by taking on challenges that earn 
              them points and a placing on the leaderboard.</p>

    <div class="projectprogress">
        <div class="projecttitle">
            <h3>Glimpse into the Process</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mainbody-02">
            <p>After 2 years of daily publishing, the content had outgrown the original 
              frame and users found it increasingly hard to find the content. With an 
              ever-growing content, the platform needed a reboot. This included fixing the 
              navigation and content structure, refreshing the visuals and aligning the 
              experience for mobile, tablet and desktop.</p>
            <h5 class="grey">CARD SORTING</h5> 
            <p class ="spacing">To understand users’ mental models, an open card sort 
              was conducted for both existing features and content. Coming from different 
              business units, management levels and usage of the application, a total of 25 
              people participated in the card sorting exercise.</p>
            <p>We realized that users who were less familiar with the application 
              (and some who were) made a distinction between learning and testing content, 
              giving the latter its category with labels like "test time” or “brainteasers”. 
              Previously, there was no clear segregation between the content types.</p>

    <div class="mainbody-03">
        <h5 class="grey">THE VISUALS</h5> 
        <p>As part of the card sorting exercise, we also asked the participants to give us 
          their candid thoughts on what Switch meant to them and what values it conveyed. 
          A separate brand exercise was also conducted with upper management to describe what 
          Switch is and what it should be. Based on all the sessions we’ve conducted, and our 
          own interpretations, we came up with three directions, inspired primarily by the topic of 
          learning. This was later distilled down to a single visual direction with further input 
          from the product owner.</p>

        <h5 class="grey">PROTOTYPING</h5> 
        <p>Working as a team, paper prototypes were a quick way of bouncing ideas off each other, 
          testing initial flows and concepts. This helped the team to move faster as everyone 
          was aligned in what we were trying to accomplish during the sprint. Throughout this time, 
          the designs were constantly printed out for others to comment and give feedback.</p>

    <div class="mainbody-03">
        <h5 class="grey">USER TESTING</h5> 
        <p>Every 3 weeks, these prototypes were shown to users to test and gather feedback on 
          the new changes. In the hour-long sessions, users were provided with a serious of tasks 
          (E.g. Complete the lesson and leave a comment). Based on their actions, questions were 
          posed to better understand their thought processes and how they would improve the current design.</p>

            <p>From mobile to tablet to desktop, we had to ensure the experience was standardized. 
              This meant optimizing the experience for each device while taking into consideration

            <p>To our surprise, the leaderboard was very popular and users made it a habit to learn 
              every day to climb up the leaderboard. However, many users also felt deflated as the 
              top learners were seemingly out of reach. Therefore, seasonal and event leaderboards 
              were added to foster healthy competition while giving every user a fair chance to 
              compete with each other.</p>

                <p>Many of the leaders were interested to see the engagement with the platform. 
                  Therefore, a dashboard view was created within PowerBI. The interface was designed 
                  to show a summary of all key data points on a single desktop screen. Thus in a 
                  glance, the leaders could have an overall picture of their respective departments 
                  with the option to dive deeper if they wanted to.</p>
