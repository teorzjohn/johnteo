            <p>Switch is a learning platform that aims to upskill employees in this period of digital transformation. Topics such as data analytics, cybersecurity and ongoing digital intiatives are introduced in short form content to make it engaging and easily digestable for users. Additionally, users are able to test their understand by taking on challenges which earns them points and a placing on the leaderboard.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="mainbody-02">
            <p>After 2 years of daily publishing, the content had outgrown the original frame and users found it increasingly hard to find the content. With an ever-growing content, the platform was in need of a reboot. This included fixing the navigation and content strucutre, refreshing the visuals and aligning the experience for mobile, tablet and desktop.</p>
            <h5 class="grey">CARD SORTING</h5> 
            <p class ="spacing">In order to understand users’ mental models, an open card sort was conducted for both exisiting features and content. Coming from different business units, management levels and usage of the application, a total of 25 people participated in the card sorting exercise.</p>
            <p>We realised that users who were less familiar with the application (and some who were) made a distinction between learning and testing content, giving the latter its own category with labels like "test time” or “brainteasers”. Previously, there was no clear segregation between the content types.</p>

    <div class="mainbody-03">
        <h5 class="grey">THE VISUALS</h5> 
        <p>As part of the card sorting exercise, we also asked the participants to give us their candid thoughts on what Switch meant to them and what values it conveyed. A seperate brand exercise was also conducted with upper management to describe what Switch is and what it should be. Based on all the sessions we’ve conducted, and our own interpretations, we’ve came up with three directions, inspired primarily by the topic of learning. This was later distilled down to a single visual direction with further input from the product owner.</p>

        <h5 class="grey">PROTOTYPING</h5> 
        <p>Working as a team, paper prototypes were a quick way of bouncing ideas off each other, testing initial flows and concepts. This helped the team to move faster as everyone was aligned in what we were trying to accomplish during the sprint. Throughout this time, the designs were constantly printed out for others to comment and give feedback.</p>

        <h5 class="grey">USER TESTING</h5> 
        <p>Every 3 weeks, these prototypes were shown to users to test and gather feedback on the new changes. In the hour long sessions, users were provided with a serious of tasks (E.g. Complete the lesson and leave a comment). Based on their actions, questions were posed to better understand their thought processes and how they would improve the current design.</p>

            <p>From mobile to tablet to desktop, we had to ensure the experience was standardized. This meant optimizing the experience for each device while taking into consideration asset management, device performance and time for development.</p>

            <p>To much of our surpise, the leaderboard was very popular and users made it a habit to learn every day to climb up the leaderboard. However, many users also felt deflated as the top learners were seemingly out of reach. Therefore, seasonal and event leaderboards were added to foster healthy competition while giving every user a fair chance to compete among each other.</p>

                <p>Many of the leaders were interested to see the engagement with the platform. Therefore, a dashboard view was created within PowerBI. The interface was designed to show a summary of all key data point on a single desktop screen. Thus in a glance, the leaders could have an overall picture of their respective departments with the option to dive deeper if they wanted to.</p>
